<h3>Include</h3>

<p>Include Rivets.js in your project. The library unconditionally occupies a `rivets` global but CommonJS and AMD module loaders such as <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/almond">almond</a> are fully supported as well, if that's your thing.</p>

<pre><code>
<script src="rivets.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>
