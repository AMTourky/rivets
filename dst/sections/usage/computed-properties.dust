<h3>Computed Properties</h3>

<p>Computed properties are functions that get re-evaluated when one or more dependent properties change. Declaring computed properties in Rivets.js is simple, just separate the function from it's dependencies with a `<`. The following `data-text` binding will get re-evaluated with `event.duration()` when either the event's `start` or `end` attribute changes.</p>

<pre><code>
<span data-text="event:duration < .start .end"></span>
</code></pre>

<p>The prepended `.` is a shorthand syntax for specifying dependencies that are on the same object as the target, so that the above declaration is effectively the same as `event:duration < event.start event.end`.</p>
