<h3>Why Isn't It A Plugin For One Of The Famous JS Libraries?</h3>

<p>Extending a library to do things it isn't supposed to do and that are not directly related with its core goal defeats the Single Responsibility Principle and is considered a bad practice besides its broad use.</p>

<p>DOM manipulation libraries should only be concerned with manipulating the DOM. Templating libraries should only be concerned with templating.</p>

<blockquote>A duck can walk, fly and swim, but he can't do any of these things well.</blockquote>

<p>Another reason for not extending an existing library is that the amount of code reused would be so minimal that it doesn't pay-off the flexibility loss. You can use Rivets.js at it's full potential with "any" other library.</p>
