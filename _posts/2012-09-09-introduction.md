Rivets.js is a declarative data binding facility that plays well with existing frameworks such as [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com) and [Stapes.js](http://hay.github.com/stapes/). It aims to be lightweight (**2.3KB** minified and gzipped), extensible, and configurable to work with any event-driven model.

Out-of-the-box it's got:

<ul class="check-list">
  <li><strong>Bi-directional data binding</strong> to and from DOM nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Computed properties</strong> through dependency mapping.</li>
  <li><strong>Formatters</strong> to allow mutating values through piping.</li>
  <li><strong>Iteration binding</strong> for binding items in an array.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom event handlers</strong> to fit your ideal workflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Uniform APIs</strong> for easily extending any of the core constructs.</li>
</ul>
