### Download

You can grab the latest stable release [here](/dist/rivets.min.js) or using the JS package manager of your choice.

    bower install rivets

### Include

Include Rivets.js in your project. The library unconditionally occupies a `rivets` global but CommonJS and AMD module loaders such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) are fully supported as well, if that's your thing.
