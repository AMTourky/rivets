Rivets.js is easily extended by adding your own custom *binders* and *formatters*. They can be added globally so that they are available within any view, or they can be added locally to a particular view.

### Binders

Binders are the sets of instructions that tell Rivets.js how to update the DOM node(s) when that particular model property changes. Rivets.js comes bundled with many of the commonly used binders for conveneience, but it's encouraged to extend Rivets.js with your own that are specific to your application.

For example, you may have some custom toggle widgets, progress bars or pie charts that you'd like to bind to so that they can be updated automatically when a model property changes. For this, you would add a two-way binder for `toggle` (model-to-view and view-to-model) and one-way binders for `progress` and `pie` (model to view only) so that you can use declarations like `data-toggle="feature.enabled"` and `data-progress="profile.completed"`.

#### One-Way Binders

For starters, let's say we just want a simple one-way binder that sets the element's color. Here we can define the `color` binder as a single function that takes the element and the current value of the model property, which we will use to updates the element's `color` style.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.binders.color = function(el, value) {
  el.style.color = value
}
{% endhighlight %}

With the above binder defined, you can now utilize the `data-color` declaration in your views.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-color="model.color">COLOR</span>
{% endhighlight %}

### Formatters

Formatters are functions that mutate the incoming and/or outgoing value of a binding. You can use them to format dates, numbers, currencies, etc. and because they work in a similar fashion to the Unix pipeline, the output of each feeds directly as input to the next one, so you can stack as many of them together as you like.

#### One-Way Formatters

This is by far the most common and practical way to use formatters --- simple read-only mutations to a value. Taking the dates example from above, we can define a `date` formatter that returns a human-friendly version of a date value.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.formatters.date = function(value){
  return moment(value).format('MMM DD, YYYY')
}
{% endhighlight %}

Formatters are applied by piping them to binding declarations using `|` as a delimiter.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-text="event.startDate | date"></span>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Formatter Arguments

Need to pass arguments to your formatter? Not a problem.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-text="billing.cardNumber | mask 4 4 ********"></span>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that all arguments are passed in as strings, so you will need to do your own type conversions to primitives if necessary.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.formatters.mask = function(value, left, right, mask) {
  formatted = value.substring(0, left)
  formatted + mask
  formatted += value.substring(value.length - right)

  return formatted
}
{% endhighlight %}
