Rivets.js is easily extended by adding your own custom *binding routines* and *formatters*. Rivets.js comes bundled with a few commonly used bindings, but users are encouraged to add their own that are specific to the needs of their application. 

#### Binding Routines

*Binding routines* are the functions that run when an observed attribute changes. Their sole concern is to describe what happens to the element when a new value comes in. All binding routines are publicly available on the `rivets.routines` object.

Let's say we wanted a `data-color` binding that sets the element's colour, here's what the routine function for that binding might look like:

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.routines.color = function(el, value) {
  el.style.color = value
}
{% endhighlight %}

With that routine defined, the following binding will update the element's color when `model.color` changes:

{% highlight html %}
<span data-color="model.color">COLOR</span>
{% endhighlight %}

Available bindings out-of-the-box:

- data-text
- data-html
- data-value
- data-show
- data-hide
- data-enabled
- data-disabled
- data-checked
- data-unchecked
- data-**\[attribute\]**
- data-class-**\[class\]**
- data-on-**\[event\]**
- data-each-**\[item\]**

#### Formatters

*Formatters* are simple one-way functions that mutate the incoming value of a binding. You can use them to format dates, numbers, currencies, etc. and because they work in a similar fashion to the Unix pipeline, the output of each feeds directly as input to the next one, so you can stack as many of them together as you like.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.formatters.money = function(value){
  return accounting.formatMoney(value)
}

rivets.formatters.date = function(value){
  return moment(value).format('MMM DD, YYYY')
}
{% endhighlight %}

Pipe bindings to formatters by using `|` as a delimiter.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-text="event.startDate | date"></span>
{% endhighlight %}
