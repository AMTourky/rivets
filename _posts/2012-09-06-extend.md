Rivets.js is easily extended by adding your own custom *binders* and *formatters*. They can be added globally so that they are available within any view, or they can be added locally to a particular view.

### Binders

Binders are the sets of instructions that tell Rivets.js how to update the DOM node(s) when that particular model property changes. Rivets.js comes bundled with many of the commonly used binders for conveneience, but it's encouraged to extend Rivets.js with your own that are specific to your application.

For example, you may have some custom toggle widgets, progress bars or pie charts that you'd like to bind to so that they can be updated automatically when a model property changes. For this, you would add a two-way binder for `toggle` (model-to-view and view-to-model) and one-way binders for `progress` and `pie` (model to view only) so that you can use declarations like `data-toggle="feature.enabled"` and `data-progress="profile.completed"`.

#### One-Way Binders

One-way binders simply update the DOM when a model property changes (model-to-view only). Let's say we want a simple binder that updates an element's color when the model property changes. Here we can define a one-way `color` binder as a single function. This function takes the element and the current value of the model property, which we will use to updates the element's color.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.binders.color = function(el, value) {
  el.style.color = value
}
{% endhighlight %}

With the above binder defined, you can now utilize the `data-color` declaration in your views.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-color="model.color">COLOR</span>
{% endhighlight %}

### Formatters

Formatters are functions that mutate the incoming and/or outgoing value of a binding. You can use them to format dates, numbers, currencies, etc. and because they work in a similar fashion to the Unix pipeline, the output of each feeds directly as input to the next one, so you can stack as many of them together as you like.

#### One-Way Formatters

This is by far the most common and practical way to use formatters --- simple read-only mutations to a value. Taking the dates example from above, we can define a `date` formatter that returns a human-friendly version of a date value.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.formatters.date = function(value){
  return moment(value).format('MMM DD, YYYY')
}
{% endhighlight %}

Formatters are applied by piping them to binding declarations using `|` as a delimiter.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-text="event.startDate | date"></span>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Two-Way Formatters


Two-way formatters are useful when you want to store a value in a particular format, such as a unix epoch time or a cent value, but still let the user input the value in a different format.

Instead of defining the formatter as a single function, you define it as an object containing `read` and `publish` functions. When a formatter is defined as a single function, Rivets assumes it to be in the read direction only. When defined as an object, Rivets uses it's `read` and `publish` functions to effectively serialize and de-serialize the value.

Using the cent value example from above, let's say we want to store a monetary value as cents but let the user input it in a dollar amount. For this we can define a two-way `currency` formatter imlemented below.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.formatters.currency = {
  read: function(value) {
    return (value / Math.pow(10, n)).toFixed(2)
  },
  publish: function(value) {
    return Math.round(parseFloat(value) * Math.pow(10, 2))
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that you can also chain bidirectional formatters with any other formatters, and in any order. They read from left to right, and publish from right to left, skipping any read-only formatters when publishing the value back to the model.

#### Formatter Arguments

Need to pass arguments to your formatter? Not a problem.

{% highlight html %}
<span data-text="billing.cardNumber | mask 4 4 ********"></span>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that all arguments are passed in as strings, so you will need to do your own type conversions to primitives if necessary.

{% highlight javascript %}
rivets.formatters.mask = function(value, left, right, mask) {
  formatted = value.substring(0, left)
  formatted + mask
  formatted += value.substring(value.length - right)

  return formatted
}
{% endhighlight %}
