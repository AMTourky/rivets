You can grab the latest stable release [here](/dist/rivets.min.js) or install using the package manager of your choice &mdash; we currently maintain releases on bower, component, npm and jam.

```bash
bower install rivets
```

Include Rivets.js in your project. The library unconditionally occupies a `rivets` global but CommonJS and AMD module loaders such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) are fully supported as well, if that's your thing.

```html
<script src="rivets.min.js"></script>
```
