The `rivets.bind` function returns a bound `Rivets.View` instance that you should hold on to for later. You may want to unbind it's listeners with `view.unbind()` and/or rebuild it's bindings with `view.build()`. You can also access the individual `Rivets.Binding` instances inside the view through `view.bindings`. This is useful for debugging purposes or if you want to unbind or manually set the value for certain bindings.
