Include Rivets.js in your project. The library unconditionally occupies a `rivets` global but CommonJS and AMD module loaders such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) are fully supported as well, if that's your thing.

    <script src="rivets.min.js"></script>
